 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

This article, which explores how and why the Gaussian copula family developed in the way it did, employs the concept of â€˜evaluation cultureâ€™, a set of practices, preferences and beliefs concerning how to determine the economic value of financial instruments that is shared by members of multiple organizations. We identify an evaluation culture, dominant within the derivatives departments of investment banks, which we call the â€˜culture of no-arbitrage modellingâ€™, and explore its relation to the development of Gaussian copula models. The article suggests that two themes from the science and technology studies literature on models (modelling as â€˜impureâ€™ bricolage, and modelling as articulating with heterogeneous objectives and constraints) help elucidate the history of Gaussian copula models in finance. }

In this article, we propose using copula models with mixed zero-beta margins for the estimation of taxonâ€“taxon covariations using data of normalized microbial relative abundances. Copulas allow for separate modeling of the dependence structure from the margins, marginal covariate adjustment, and uncertainty measurement.Our method shows that a two-stage maximum-likelihood approach provides accurate estimation of model parameters. A corresponding two-stage likelihood ratio test for the dependence parameter is derived and is used for constructing covariation networks. Simulation studies show that the test is valid, robust, and more powerful than tests based upon Pearsonâ€™s and rank correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be used to build biologically meaningful microbial networks based on a dataset from the American Gut Project.R package for implementation is available at https://github.com/rebeccadeek/CoMiCoN.},
